# MBA Students Data Management

## Project Description

This project involves the creation of an **8-table relational database** designed to manage and analyze data related to MBA students. The database was built to support various aspects of student data management, including personal information, academic performance, course enrollment, and more.

## Key Components

1. **Database Schema:**
   - **Tables:** The project includes 8 tables, each representing a different aspect of the student data, such as students, courses, enrollment, grades, etc.
   - **Relationships:** The tables are interrelated using foreign keys, ensuring data integrity and enabling complex queries.

2. **Views:**
   - Created several views to simplify data retrieval and present a summarized view of specific aspects of the data.

3. **Joins:**
   - Implemented various SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables, providing comprehensive insights and supporting detailed analysis.

4. **Stored Procedures:**
   - Developed stored procedures to encapsulate frequently used queries and operations, improving efficiency and ensuring consistency.

5. **Diagram:**
   - The project includes an ER diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram) that visually represents the database structure, showcasing the tables, relationships, and key attributes.

## Usage

The project can be used by educational institutions to manage student data efficiently, track academic performance, and provide meaningful insights through advanced querying capabilities.

## Repository Contents

- **SQL Scripts:** Contains all the SQL scripts for creating tables, views, joins, and stored procedures.
- **Diagram:** Includes the ER diagram illustrating the database schema and relationships.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Execute the SQL scripts in the recommended order to set up the database.
3. Use the views and stored procedures to interact with the data.
